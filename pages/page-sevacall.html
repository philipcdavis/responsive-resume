				<h1>About the project</h1>
				<p>I was initially brought on to the Sevacall team as a design intern back in 2009 when I was a freshman in college. During my time there, I designed one of my first ever websites. SevaCall asked me to join the team again during my senior year of College (2011-2012) where I was able to lead the design team in working on a redesign and rebrand of the site.</p>
